# Email Validation Examples

This document shows how the AI assistant now handles email validation with helpful feedback.

## ✅ Valid Email Examples

**User:** "My email is john@company.com"
**AI:** "Thanks! I've got your email. How can I help you today?"
📝 *Records: email = "john@company.com"*

**User:** "My email is sarah.doe@tech-startup.io"
**AI:** "Perfect! I've recorded your email. What brings you to my portfolio today?"
📝 *Records: email = "sarah.doe@tech-startup.io"*

## ❌ Invalid Email Examples

### Missing @ Symbol
**User:** "My email is johncompany.com"
**AI:** "I notice there might be an issue with your email format. Could you please provide your email in the format: user@domain.com? For example: john@company.com"

### Spaces in Email
**User:** "My email is john @company.com"
**AI:** "I see there are spaces in your email address. Email addresses shouldn't contain spaces. Could you please provide it as: john@company.com?"

### Missing Domain
**User:** "My email is john@"
**AI:** "It looks like your email address is incomplete. Could you please provide the full email address including the domain? For example: john@company.com"

### Empty Email
**User:** "My email is"
**AI:** "I didn't catch your email address. Could you please provide your complete email address? For example: yourname@company.com"

## 🎯 Gmail Detection

**User:** "My email is john@gmail.com"
**AI:** "Thanks John! I've got your email. I notice you're using Gmail - that's perfectly fine! I also have a professional email if you prefer: lovish@yourdomain.com. What brings you to my portfolio today?"
📝 *Records: email = "john@gmail.com" + note about Gmail detection*

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Validation Rules:
1. **Format Check**: Must contain @ symbol and domain
2. **No Spaces**: Email cannot contain spaces
3. **Length Limit**: Maximum 254 characters
4. **Domain Check**: Detects Gmail and suggests professional alternative

### Error Handling:
```javascript
// Example validation response
{
  "recorded": "error",
  "message": "Please provide a valid email address (e.g., user@example.com)",
  "validationError": true,
  "field": "email"
}
```

### Database Validation:
- Mongoose schema-level validation
- Prevents invalid emails from being saved
- Provides clear error messages

## 🎨 Frontend Integration

The frontend can use the validation errors to:

1. **Show Error Messages**: Display validation errors to users
2. **Highlight Fields**: Mark email input as invalid
3. **Provide Suggestions**: Show correct email format
4. **Real-time Validation**: Validate as user types

### Example Frontend Response Handling:
```javascript
const response = await fetch('/api/chat', { ... });
const data = await response.json();

if (data.toolOutputs) {
  data.toolOutputs.forEach(output => {
    if (output.validationError && output.field === 'email') {
      // Show email validation error in UI
      showEmailError(output.error);
    }
  });
}
```
